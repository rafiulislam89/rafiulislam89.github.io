<caption>Why did I choose to study CSE?</caption>

<tr><td>Since I was in school. My fascination was for electrical devices. However I was excited to make/built something new and one thing I must say,  I'm a huge fan of Albert Einstein. As he studied at Munich Polytechnic.That encouraged me and I made a decision to admit a polytechnic institute and I did. That's why I studied a polytechnic institute. Moreover my journey was not so good. Later on i realize that EEE is not for me I'm much more fascinated on coding. That's why coding became a part of my life.As i have seen a quotation somewhere "Follow your heart" . So, I did and I'm loving it.</td></tr>
